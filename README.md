## The aim of the project

Basic app which has one view (for now). Based on [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVEjSmKFUVI&t=1130s).

## What is my motivation?

I want to learn containerization apps using Docker. 

## Features

- [x] Created index view.

## Technologies & Documentation

- [Python 3](https://docs.python.org/3/)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/)
- [uWSGI](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Installation

<details>
<summary>Python:</summary>

Visit https://www.python.org/downloads/ and type which installing package you prefer (by your operating system) and download the package.

After download, go through installation process.

After above, let's check if Python is installed on your computer. To do this, open your terminal or command prompt and type:

For MacOS/Linux:
```
python3 --version
```

For Windows:
```
python --version
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Virtual environment:</summary>

[More info about venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

Open terminal/command prompt and create directory where you will create a django project using commands below:

```
ls                                                   # to check content of your domain directory
mkdir <directory_name>                               # to create a separated directory for project
cd <directory_name>                                  # just to go into new directory
python3 -m venv <virtualenv_name>                    # to create virtualenv using MacOS terminal
python -m venv <virtualenv_name>                     # to create virtualenv on Windows
source <virtualenv_name>/bin/activate                # to activate virtualenv on MacOS
<virtualenv_name>\Scripts\activate                   # to activate virtualenv on Windows

(<virtualenv_name>) <username>@<actual_directory> %  # after above you should see the (<virtualenv_name>). This line appears on MacOS.
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Flask:</summary>

If you did above tutorials, now you should have schema of your files like:

```
Desktop/
    <directory_name>/
        <virtualenv_name>
```

Now we can install Flask framework. Simply type in your terminal/command prompt:

```
pip3 install flask     # on MacOS
pip install flask      # on Windows
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>All packages included in requirements.txt:</summary>

<details>
<summary>First option (prefered):</summary>

After clone this repo, type command:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt        # on MacOS
pip install -r requirements.txt         # on Windows
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Second option:</summary>

Open file ```requirements.txt``` and type command with every package name:
```
pip3 install <package_name>     # on MacOS
pip install <package_name>      # on Windows
```

</details>

</details>

Perfect! Now, it's time to last episode.

##  Run

We've seen how to run venv. Keep that running!


<details>
<summary>Now we can simply clone this repo, and see if it's working on our machine (in case we did everything above count creating virtualenv):</summary>

```
git init                                                # to initialize repository
git clone https://github.com/xwojziarnik/cepik_app      # to clone this repository into your local machine

export FLASK_APP=<file name where you used command app.run()>.py
export FLASK_ENV=development                            # to make a development env in app, for example to rerun automaticly

flask fun     # using MacOS
flask fun     # using Windows
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Useful Docker commands:</summary>

```
docker-compose build            # Docker is creating containers
docker-compose up               # Docker is rerunning app using containers
docker-compose up --build       # Docker is recreating containers (after changes in app files)
docker-compose down             # Docker is removing containers
```

</details>

And that's it! Great job!
